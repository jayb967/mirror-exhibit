- No rounded corners to maintain the modern contemporary style

## ðŸ”§ Technical Notes
- Uses JSX instead of TSX to avoid potential type-related issues
- All components are client-side only with no server components
- Uses the `useEffect` hook to fetch data after mounting
- Simplified component structure to avoid circular dependencies
- Uses the `suppressHydrationWarning` prop to prevent React from showing hydration mismatch errors
