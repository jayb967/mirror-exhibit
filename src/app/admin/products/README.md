## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Variations Count Rendering Issue
**Problem:** The variations_count field from Supabase aggregation was being rendered directly as a React child, causing the error "Objects are not valid as a React child (found: object with keys {count})".

**Solution:**
- Updated the rendering logic to properly access `variations_count[0].count`
- Added proper null checks and fallback to stock_quantity
- Updated TypeScript interface to reflect the actual data structure from Supabase

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// Before (causing error)
{product.variations_count || product.stock_quantity || 0}

// After (fixed)
{product.variations_count && product.variations_count.length > 0
  ? product.variations_count[0].count
  : product.stock_quantity || 0}
```

## üîç Technical Notes

### Supabase Query Structure
The main products query includes a count aggregation for variations:
```sql
SELECT *, variations_count:product_variations(count)
```
This returns variations_count as an array of objects with count properties, not a simple number.

### Sorting Behavior
- Status field sorting handles null values by placing them last regardless of sort direction
- Other fields use standard ascending/descending sort
- Default sort is by created_at in descending order (newest first)

### Table Interactions
- **Clickable Rows**: Click anywhere on a product row to open the edit modal
- **Checkbox Selection**: Click checkbox to select/deselect products for bulk actions
- **Action Buttons**: Edit and View buttons in the Actions column
- **Smart Click Handling**: Checkbox and action buttons don't trigger row click

### Filtering and Pagination
- **Search**: Text search across product names
- **Category Filter**: Dropdown to filter by product category
- **Missing SEO Filter**: Checkbox to show only products without SEO data
- **Page Size**: Configurable results per page (5, 10, 25, 50, 100)
- **Auto-reset**: Page resets to 1 when filters change

### Stock Display Logic
- If product has variations, shows variations count
- If no variations, shows stock_quantity
- Color coding: red for low stock (< 5), gray for normal stock
