## üìù Usage Notes

### CSV Format
The import page expects a CSV file in the Shopify product export format, which includes:
- Product information (Handle, Title, Body, Vendor, etc.)
- Variant information (Size, Frame type, Price, etc.)
- Image URLs
- SEO information

### Import Process
1. Click "Download Sample CSV" to get a template
2. Prepare your CSV file with product data
3. Click "Choose File" to select your CSV file
4. The system will automatically:
   - Parse the CSV file
   - Process products and variations
   - Download and upload images to Cloudinary
   - Create categories and brands if they don't exist
   - Update existing products if they already exist

### Error Handling
- The import process continues even if some products fail
- Errors are logged and displayed in the error section
- Administrators can fix issues and re-upload the CSV file

### Performance Considerations
- Images are processed in batches to avoid overwhelming the server
- The import process is designed to handle large CSV files
- Progress is tracked and displayed in real-time
