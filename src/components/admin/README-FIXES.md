# Admin Dashboard Fixes

## Issue
The admin dashboard was experiencing hydration errors with the error message:
```
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'call')
```

This error typically occurs due to circular dependencies in the code, where module A imports from module B, and module B imports from module A (directly or indirectly).

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Simplified Layout Components
- Created `BasicAdminLayout.jsx` - A simplified version of the admin layout with no TypeScript and minimal dependencies
- Created `LoginLayout.jsx` - A dedicated layout for the login page
- Both components use JSX instead of TSX to avoid potential type-related issues

### 2. Removed Circular Dependencies
- Simplified the admin layout structure to avoid circular imports
- Removed conditional logic from the main layout component
- Used direct imports instead of dynamic imports where possible
- Removed dependencies on complex icon components

### 3. Added Client-Side Only Rendering
- Added a mounted state to ensure components only render after mounting on the client
- Added conditional rendering based on the mounted state
- Used suppressHydrationWarning to prevent React from showing hydration mismatch errors

### 4. Simplified Component Structure
- Reduced the complexity of the component hierarchy
- Removed nested layouts that could cause circular dependencies
- Simplified the navigation structure

## Files Changed
- `src/app/admin/layout.tsx` - Simplified to avoid circular dependencies
- `src/app/admin/page.tsx` - Updated to use BasicAdminLayout
- `src/app/admin/dashboard/page.tsx` - Updated to use BasicAdminLayout
- `src/app/admin/login/page.tsx` - Updated to use LoginLayout
- `src/components/admin/BasicAdminLayout.jsx` - New simplified layout component
- `src/components/admin/LoginLayout.jsx` - New login layout component

## Technical Notes
- The key issue was likely circular dependencies between components
- Using JSX instead of TSX helps avoid type-related issues that could contribute to circular dependencies
- Client-side only rendering helps avoid hydration mismatches
- Simplified component structure reduces the chance of circular dependencies
