# Checkout Component Fixes

This document outlines the fixes implemented for the checkout page issues.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Returning Customer Section Hidden for Authenticated Users
- **Issue**: The "Returning customer?" section was showing even when users were already logged in
- **Fix**: Added conditional rendering to only show this section when `!isAuthenticated`
- **Location**: `CheckoutArea.tsx` lines 686-720

### 2. Coupon State Carried Over from Cart Page
- **Issue**: Coupons applied on the cart page were not being carried over to checkout
- **Fix**: 
  - Load coupon state from Redux store on component mount
  - Automatically expand coupon section if coupon is already applied
  - Revalidate coupon when address information is available
- **Location**: `CheckoutArea.tsx` lines 50-254

### 3. Form Prefilled for Authenticated Users
- **Issue**: Form fields were not being prefilled with user profile data for logged-in users
- **Fix**: 
  - Added effect to load user profile data from Supabase
  - Prefill form fields with profile data and Clerk user information
  - Handle both JSONB and separate field address formats
- **Location**: `CheckoutArea.tsx` lines 245-301

### 4. Shipping Method Validation
- **Issue**: Users could place orders without selecting a shipping method
- **Fix**: 
  - Enhanced form validation to check for shipping method selection
  - Disable order button when no shipping options are available
  - Show appropriate error messages
- **Location**: `CheckoutArea.tsx` lines 162-164, 1067

### 5. Order Creation Flow
- **Issue**: Orders were being created after payment, causing issues with order tracking
- **Fix**: 
  - Create orders in database before Stripe payment
  - Pass order ID to Stripe session
  - Include all order details including coupon information
- **Location**: 
  - `CheckoutArea.tsx` lines 586-647
  - New API endpoint: `src/app/api/orders/create/route.ts`

### 6. Coupon Data in Orders
- **Issue**: Coupon information was not being stored with orders
- **Fix**: 
  - Added coupon fields to orders table
  - Include coupon data in order creation
  - Display coupon discounts on order success page
- **Location**: 
  - Database migration: `database/migrations/05_add_coupon_fields_to_orders.sql`
  - Order creation: `src/app/api/orders/create/route.ts`
  - Order success page: `src/app/order/success/page.tsx`

## Database Changes

### New Columns Added to Orders Table
- `coupon_id`: UUID reference to coupons table
- `coupon_code`: TEXT for historical reference
- `coupon_discount_amount`: DECIMAL(10,2) for actual discount applied
- `coupon_discount_type`: TEXT ('percentage' or 'fixed')

### New Database Function
- `increment_coupon_usage(coupon_id UUID)`: Safely increments coupon usage count

## API Changes

### New Endpoint: `/api/orders/create`
- Creates orders in database before payment
- Handles both authenticated and guest users
- Includes coupon data and order items
- Increments coupon usage count

### Updated Endpoint: `/api/create-checkout-session`
- Now accepts discount parameter
