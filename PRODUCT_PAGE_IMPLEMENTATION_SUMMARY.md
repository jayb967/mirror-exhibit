## üß™ Testing Instructions

### 1. Basic Functionality Test
1. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3003/product/8f52d38a-631a-4767-baaf-c16f07958da4?id=8f52d38a-631a-4767-baaf-c16f07958da4`
2. Verify the product page loads with fallback data
3. Test all four tabs (Product Details, Additional Info, Reviews, FAQ)
4. Verify smooth tab transitions and content display

### 2. Multi-Image Test (After Adding Sample Data)
1. Run the SQL script: `database/add_sample_product_images.sql` in Supabase
2. Refresh the product page
3. Verify multiple thumbnail images appear below main image
4. Click different thumbnails to test image switching
5. Verify "Main" badge appears on primary image thumbnail

### 3. Responsive Design Test
1. Test on desktop (full thumbnail gallery)
2. Test on mobile (smaller thumbnails, centered layout)
3. Verify tab navigation works on all screen sizes

### 4. Error Handling Test
1. Test with invalid product ID
2. Verify fallback product data displays correctly
3. Test with products that have no additional images

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### State Management
- `selectedImageIndex`: Tracks currently displayed image
- `activeTab`: Manages which tab content is shown
- `allImages`: Computed array of all available images with fallback logic

### Image Handling
- Prioritizes `product_images` from database
- Falls back to main `image_url` if no additional images
- Sorts images by `sort_order` field (creates array copy to avoid read-only mutation)
- Handles missing alt text gracefully

### Bug Fixes Applied
- **Read-only Array Mutation**: Fixed error when sorting `product_images` by creating a copy with spread operator `[...product.product_images]` before sorting
- **Add to Cart Button**: Fixed text alignment by adding flexbox centering and proper height
- **Green Badge Removal**: Removed unwanted "Main" badge from thumbnail images
- **Tab Naming**: Changed "Product Details" tab to "Description" to show database description content
- **Carousel Modal Loop**: Fixed infinite loop in product carousel by replacing local `ProductOptionsModal` with global modal system (`useGlobalModal` hook)
- **Logo Fallback**: Implemented proper image error handling with `onError` event and state management to show logo (`/assets/img/logo/ME_Logo.png`) when images fail to load, matching ProductCard behavior
- **Image Aspect Ratio**: Fixed stretched product card images across all components by adding `objectFit: 'cover'` and proper styling to maintain intended image proportions (OurProductArea, ProductAreaHomeThree, ProductAreaHomeFour, ProductAreaHomeFive)
- **Card Height Consistency**: Fixed variable card heights in product carousel by implementing fixed height (400px) with flexbox layout and text truncation for long titles
- **Global Modal CSS**: Fixed missing modal display by importing `product-modal.css` in AppWrapper to enable proper modal styling and visibility

### Tab System
- Pure React state management (no external dependencies)
- Conditional rendering based on `activeTab` state
- Smooth CSS transitions and animations

### API Response Format
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "product": {
    "id": "...",
    "title": "...",
    "description": "...",
    "price": 199.99,
    "image": "...",
    "brand": "...",
    "category": "...",
    "variations": [...],
    "product_images": [
      {
        "id": "...",
        "product_id": "...",
        "image_url": "...",
        "is_primary": true,
        "sort_order": 1,
        "alt_text": "..."
      }
    ],
    "is_featured": false
  }
}
```

## üöÄ Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

## üìä Performance Considerations

- **Lazy Loading**: Images load as needed
- **Optimized Queries**: Single API call fetches all required data
- **Efficient State Management**: Minimal re-renders with proper state structure
- **CSS Animations**: Hardware-accelerated transitions for smooth UX
